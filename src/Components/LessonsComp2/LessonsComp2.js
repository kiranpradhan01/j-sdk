                    <p>According to the Harvard Business Review, there’s evidence to show that what advertisements you see can influence how you see yourself.<br/><br/>
                    Seeing advertisements that are targeted towards you tend to influence you much more about how you percieve yourself regarding whatever trait the advertisement encompasses. If the advertisement doesn't pertain to you, then it doesn't end up having that effect.<br/><br/>
                    The Russian ad campaigns were targeting individuals that were passionate about polarizing topics. The language and formats used in the advertisements were meant to inflate the polarized ideas that individuals had, causing them to develop more intense feelings about those topics. This was then exploited through disinformation around that topic. <br/><br/>
                    The advertisements were a vector for disinformation, and the reach that social media ads provided for them caused the worldwide impact. <br/><br/>
                    This isn’t to say that social media advertising is bad, it’s much more effective to target the users you want to reach rather than hope one of the random customers you advertise to is interested. However, it’s important to see how something very important like social media advertisements can become a vector for misinformation and disinformation.<br/><br/>
                    This is <strong>cognition’s</strong> goal, to help you understand the <strong>vectors</strong> of <strong>misinformation</strong> and <strong>disinformation</strong>. We’re not here to tell you what’s right, but we want you to have the tools to determine whether or not the information you’re viewing is credible and reliable.
