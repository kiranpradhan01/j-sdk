## Creators
We are a team of four students at the University of Washington Information School. We have experience in front-end development, back-end development, design, research and all the  niches in between those topics.

June 2020 Update: Although we have been developing this platform for the past 2 quarters, we are officially handing this project off to our sponsors so that future students may be able to build on our work. If you are interested in  developing these topics further, please contact [Chris Coward](mailto:ccoward@uw.edu) from the [Center for an Informed Public](https://www.cip.uw.edu/).
