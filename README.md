We're a team of four students at the Information School. We have experience in front-end development, back-end development, design, research and all the little niches in between those topics. Although we have been developing this platform for the past 2 quarters, we are officially handing this project back to our sponsors so that future students may be able to continue our work. If you are interested in further developing on these topics, please contact Rolf Hapel from the Center for an Informed Public at <rhapel@uw.edu>.
